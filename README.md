# RegistrationSearch - Quicksort Enhancement

The **RegistrationSearch** application is designed to help the New York Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) efficiently manage and search vehicle registrations. This project enhances the application's sorting mechanism by implementing the **quicksort** algorithm, offering significant performance improvements over the previously implemented insertion and merge sort algorithms.

## Project Overview

Sorting vehicle registrations efficiently is critical to improving the DMV's operational performance. Quicksort, known for its speed and resource efficiency, provides a robust solution for this requirement. It uses a **divide-and-conquer** approach to partition and recursively sort the data.

### Key Features
- **Quicksort Algorithm**: A highly efficient sorting method implemented to replace insertion and merge sort.
- **Optimized Performance**: Faster sorting and reduced resource consumption compared to simpler methods.
- **Real-World Application**: Enhances the scalability and speed of the RegistrationSearch application for large datasets.

## How Quicksort Works
1. **Select a Pivot**: Choose an element as the pivot.
2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange elements so that all items smaller than the pivot are on its left, and those greater are on its right.
3. **Recursive Sorting**: Recursively apply the process to the left and right subarrays.
4. **Combine Results**: The entire array is sorted when all subarrays are sorted.

## Lab Goals
The goal of this lab was to:
1. Implement the quicksort algorithm in the RegistrationSearch application.
2. Optimize the sorting process for vehicle registrations.
3. Improve the application's overall efficiency.
